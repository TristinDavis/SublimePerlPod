# Perl POD for Sublime Text 2/3

This is a plugin for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), which allows validation and preview of [Perl POD (plain old documentation)](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) in Sublime Text.

Right now, there's nothing to see here, since this plugin is not finished yet. If you're curious and would like to try this plugin in its alpha stage, please take a look at the [devel](https://github.com/vifo/SublimePerlPod/tree/devel) branch.
